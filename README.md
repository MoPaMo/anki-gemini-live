# Anki Gemini Live

An Anki extension that connects to Google's Gemini Live API to provide a natural voice-based flashcard review experience. It's like having a study partner who asks you questions, listens to your answers, evaluates them, and provides helpful feedback - all through natural conversation.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¤ **Voice Interaction**: Speak naturally with Gemini AI during card reviews
- ðŸ”Š **Audio Responses**: Hear questions and feedback in Gemini's voice
- âœ… **Automatic Rating**: AI evaluates your answers and rates cards accordingly
- ðŸ’¡ **Explanations**: Ask for clarifications and deeper understanding
- ðŸ“š **Seamless Integration**: Works with your existing Anki decks and scheduling

## How It Works

1. Start a Gemini Live session from Anki's Tools menu
2. Gemini asks you flashcard questions in a natural voice
3. You answer verbally through your microphone
4. Gemini evaluates your answer and rates it (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
5. Get feedback, explanations, and move to the next card
6. Your review progress is automatically saved to Anki
